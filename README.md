Implementation of Huffman encoding / decoding.

Use the `-e` flag to specify a file to encode.
Use the `-d` flag to specify a file to decode.

** For some reason, encoding a text file produces a file that is larger than the original. **
I'm not entirely sure why this is as to my mind, I've followed the procedure for huffman
encoding to the letter, but it will be something that I will look into in the future.

Decoding is unaffected by this though, and works exactly as expected.
